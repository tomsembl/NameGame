# NameGame
A web-based game for mobiles. A Jackbox-style implementation of The Name Game

<h2>
  Summary
</h2>
<p>
  The Name Game has players join teams and write out custom names of celebrities, fictional characters, et cetera.<br>
  Names are drawn at random from the list of names created by all players at the start of the game.<br>
  Teams take turns, with one player describing the names and their team attempting to guess the names.<br>
  The goal of each team is to get as many names guessed correctly within the time limit.<br>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Suitable for 4+ players, however best at 6-12 players.</li>
    <li>Best played in-person, but it's also okay over a video call, preferrably with cameras turned on for round 4.</li>
    <li>Each Player will need to join via their own device (best optimised for smartphone).</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>
  Rules
</h2>
<h4>When Describing</h4>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you break any of these rules, you'll need to end your turn early using the concede button.</li>
    <li>Make up your own rules if you like. I've found these rules make for the fairest gameplay:</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Adhere to the restrictions of the current round (shown at the top of the game screen)<br>
  <em>In Round x: Your explanation can use y words:</em></li>

    <li>Round 4: No words, miming only.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li>Don't use the name itself, or part of the name, in your explanation</li>
  <ul>
    <li>eg. Name: <em>John Howard</em>&nbsp; Don't say: <em>"first name <strong>John</strong>, PM with big eyebrows"</em></li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li>Don't use a letter within name or part of the name in your explanation</li>
